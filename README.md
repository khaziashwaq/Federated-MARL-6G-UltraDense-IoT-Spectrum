# Privacy-Preserving Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Spectrum Management in Ultra-Dense 6G IoT Networks

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** framework for spectrum allocation in **ultra-dense 6G IoT networks**, focusing on **privacy preservation**. The goal is to design an optimal spectrum allocation strategy that improves throughput, fairness, and interference management, while ensuring data privacy using federated learning techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Federated Multi-Agent RL** for real-time, decentralized decision-making in ultra-dense IoT networks.
- **Privacy Preservation** through federated learning to ensure no raw data is shared between agents.
- **6G IoT Network Simulation** to optimize spectrum allocation in high-density environments.
- **Throughput, Fairness, and Interference Management** to optimize resource allocation among devices.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a **multi-agent reinforcement learning** system where each IoT device optimizes its spectrum usage.
- Preserve **data privacy** by utilizing **federated learning**, ensuring that each agent only shares model updates, not raw data.
- Simulate an **ultra-dense IoT environment**, mimicking the complexities and requirements of **6G** networks.
- Evaluate performance in terms of **throughput**, **latency**, **fairness**, and **interference**.

## Technologies Used:
- **Federated Learning**: TensorFlow Federated, PySyft
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Stable-Baselines3, RLlib
- **Simulation**: NS-3, OpenAI Gym
- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: PySyft, TenSEAL
